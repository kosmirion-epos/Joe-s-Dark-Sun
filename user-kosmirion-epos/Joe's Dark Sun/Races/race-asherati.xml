			<h4>ASHERATI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Asherati character has certain traits deriving from your Asherati ancestry.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Ability Score Increase,</em>
				</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Age.</em>
				</strong>Asherati mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 130 years.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Size.</em>
				</strong> Asherati are between 5-6 feet tall and typically weigh 170 pounds. Your size is Medium.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Speed.</em>
				</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
			</p>
			<!-- spacer-->
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Darkvision.</em>
				</strong> Possessing the gift of light, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Sandswim.</em>
				</strong> As a merfolk is to the sea, an Asherati is to sand, ash, and dust. (This excludes quicksand, packed dirt, or rock) An Asherati can swim through sand, ash, and dust at a speed equal to their walking speed whilst wearing no armour. Beginning at level 3, this can be accomplished whilst wearing light armour. An Asherati breathes normally while under the sands. This supernatural ability doesn’t allow an Asherati to breath in mediums other than sand, dust, or ash, nor does it allow an Asherati to hold its breath longer than normal in water or dangerous gasses. Whilst Asherati cannot swim through quicksand without making the necessary saving throw and can be suffocated whilst failing it, they do have advantage on checks to identify its presence.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Body Lamp.</em>
				</strong> As a bonus action, an Asherati can make their skin glow at will, providing bright light out to 30 feet and shadowy illumination out to 60 feet. In a medium of loose soil, such as sand, dust, or ash, a peculiar quality of the light allows an Asherati to make out solid objects up to 30 feet away. Under the sand, this light is sufficient for navigation and general identification of objects, but not for reading, recognizing individuals, or other similar feats of finer perception. This ability does not allow an Asherati to see invisible creatures or creatures with concealment more easily than normal. Other creatures in the sand with an Asherati do not gain this special sight, but they can see the sand take on a warm, orange glow.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Asherati Cunning.</em>
				</strong> Asherati have proficiency in the Stealth skill.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<strong>
					<em>Languages.</em>
				</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Asherati.
